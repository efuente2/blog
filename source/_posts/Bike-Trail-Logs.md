### Trails:

## Iron Hill Bike Trail: 
- Located on the the south side of red top mountain, and spans about 3.9 miles in a loop.
- Its mostly flat with a gravel surface
- The Climbing is not super difficult, on my 8 speed bike I max out going up the hills but don't feel the need for additional gears.
- About 75 to 80 % of the trail runs along side the water. 
- There are three bridges along the trail. 
- There is parking onsite with additional overflow parking available as well. 
- Without a yearly pass the entry to the trail is 5$ as of 2024.
